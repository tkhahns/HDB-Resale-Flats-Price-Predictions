CS3244 Group 31 README 

The submission folder contains 2 notebooks that is to be read in sequential order.
1_feature_engineering+EDA.ipynb, followed by 2_model_building.ipynb

It appears that opening the notebook in local IDE would have some formatting issue that would not output the dataframes by default. 
This is because most of our work is done in Google Collab. For better viewing purposes, we would like to request you to
open the notebook in Google Collab in order to see all output lines clearly.
